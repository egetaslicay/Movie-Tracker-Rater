# MyMovieShelf  
## A Personal Movie Tracking Logging & Rating Application


Task 2: 

**MyMovieShelf** is a desktop Java application designed for users to log the movies they’ve watched, rate them, write personal notes, and organize them into custom collections. The application will begin as a console-based program and will eventually feature a graphical user interface. MyMovieShelf will support saving and loading the full application state, so users can return to their movie library at any time without losing data.

**This application is intended for anyone who wants a private, customizable way to track their movie-watching habits.** Instead of relying on public platforms like Letterboxd, MyMovieShelf provides users with a personalized and offline space to manage their film collection. Users can rate movies, record personal thoughts or reviews, and sort or group films in meaningful ways and view films they have watched sorted by rating, genre etc.

**I chose this project because I'm passionate about movies and often find myself rewatching films without remembering what I originally thought of them. I’ve always wanted a lightweight, offline tool where I can reflect on what I’ve watched and organize movies my own way.** This project also gives me the opportunity to create something genuinely useful to me, while practicing clean object-oriented design and working with saving/loading state all of which will help me grow as a developer.
