# MyMovieShelf  
## A Personal Movie Tracking & Rating Application

**MyMovieShelf** is a desktop Java application that allows users to log the movies theyâ€™ve watched, rate them, write personal notes, and organize them into custom collections. The application features a graphical user interface and supports saving and loading the full application state, so users can return to their movie library at any time without losing data.

**This application is intended for anyone who wants a private, customizable way to track their movie-watching habits.** Unlike public platforms like Letterboxd, MyMovieShelf provides users with a personalized and offline space to manage their film collection. Users can rate movies, record personal reviews, and organize films by rating, genre, or custom categories.
