# MyMovieShelf  
## A Personal Movie Tracking Logging & Rating Application


**MyMovieShelf** is a desktop Java application designed for users to log the movies theyâ€™ve watched, rate them, write personal notes, and organize them into custom collections. The application will begin as a console-based program and will eventually feature a graphical user interface. MyMovieShelf will support saving and loading the full application state, so users can return to their movie library at any time without losing data.

**This application is intended for anyone who wants a private, customizable way to track their movie-watching habits.** Instead of relying on public platforms like Letterboxd, MyMovieShelf provides users with a personalized and offline space to manage their film collection. Users can rate movies, record personal thoughts or reviews, and sort or group films in meaningful ways and view films they have watched sorted by rating, genre etc.
